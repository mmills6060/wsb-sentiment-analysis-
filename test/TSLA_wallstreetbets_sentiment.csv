I approached him after the speaking event concluded to discuss my appreciation of his work and the incredible potential of the tech he's developing and electric cars and SpaceX in general. He was very rude and dismissive and seemed to only want to talk to my mom. I kept having to get his attention but he kept asking my mom if she wants to see his ""BFR"", whatever that means. Finally I got around to asking about taking a picture with him and of course he agreed, but only if my mom would be in the picture with us. By this point I was getting some seriously weird vibes from the dude, so I decided to stand between him and my mother for the picture. At the end of the countdown right when we said ""cheese!"", I felt a sharp pain in my side and yelped, ruining the picture. I pulled up my shirt to see what happened, and there was a tiny pin-sized hole in my side that was bleeding quite a bit. I'm not sure what exactly happened, but I swear Elon stabbed me with a syringe or something. He then complained loudly about how I ruined the pic and suggested we take another with him in the middle. At this point I just want to be done with this weirdo so I'm like whatever. So we line up again and I shit you not, the guy palms my mom's entire ass cheek and squeezes. Obviously my mom was extremely offended and forcefully removed his hand while walking away. This made Elon angry and he started yelling profanities at her.

I'm a data analyst, but I analyze (my own) data in ways most dark pool gurus don't. Throughout the day there's what I refer to as ""Money prices"", in a nutshell, this is where the most liquidity (focal point of max buyers/sellers) lay. Often times, the spot price of a stock differs from a ""money price"" whether it be above/below by a few cents. Other times, the difference between a spot/money price may be large when a whale buyer/seller comes in. When this happens, essentially what a whale (buyer or seller) does in order to accumulate/distribute large quantities of shares, is they agree to do it at a discount to spot price (in sellers case) or a price well above spot (in a buyers case) in order to fulfill their entire order. Large orders in this example, create an arbitrage range for market makers to either 1) increase their liquidity (buying power) when spot price is currently at a discount to where whale buyer agrees to buy at or 2) decrease liquidity (open a short position) while spot price is still trading higher than where it eventually, will end up trading at. Obviously, there's been plentiful action going into $TSLA as far back as a month ago when it was still trading well below $1,000. When you put 2&amp;2 together, $TSLA was trading at $261 in late 2019, before hitting $350 within the month, seeing more TAV action, &amp; tripling over the next 2 months. Plenty of times throughout the day I'll see money prices above/below a HOD/LOD for a stock, which creates an arbitrage trade for me to get long/short on. But $TSLA rn, is definitely one I'd prefer to hold onto over the next few months. The data I have, analyze, &amp; do have my own bias on, isn't something I care to share publicly unless in my own discord chat or my blog. I was the only (as far as I know) to call the top of the greatest bear market since 2019. I posted a blog post about it the 17th of Feb.

Wild times. I'm hosting a (free) discord chat to any&amp;everyone who may be interested in seeing my perspective &amp; how I trade certain aspects of the market, as well as those calls that easily creates the arbitrage types of trades I'm talking about when you watch a stock move .35% within the hour based on what a money price can tell you. I don't trade technicals, don't care about fundamentals, &amp; solely trade based on this data.

Take a look at TWTR in 2018 when they entered.  TSLA is +10x larger.   Possibly priced in, but could also be the short squeeze of the century.  and if it doesn't happen this quarter, still very likely after Q3.

216,"Kanye will take $TSLA to Mars.Ok so hear me out. We all know Tesla is incredibly overvalued by any dumbass fundamental standpoint but does anyone really care...markets don‚Äôt seem to and neither should you. It makes you wonder...‚ÄùAre there really people out there who are more (autistic) informed than myself and know something I don‚Äôt?‚Äù Maybe...

Let me cut to the chase. Everyone saw that picture of Kanye and Elon flexing a newly developed relationship and potential future collab on some sort of tendie venture. Then, days later we see Kanye announce to the world his plans to run for president, with Elon proudly endorsing the vision on Twitter. If it‚Äôs not clear to you what I‚Äôm about to say, you‚Äôre obviously retarded, but Kayne is going to announce Elon as his VP. INSANE, but incredible power move.

Not only does this allow Elon an easy way for  to further TSLA‚Äôs brand through God knows what shenanigans he could pull as VP, but it allows him direct access at controlling the legislature that will inevitably allow all these other stupid fuck electric car companies to compete with TSLA. Just as many other large companies have leveraged the White House for their own benefit, the same would be expected here.

So...Kanye wins the election. We see Elon in the White House. TSLA becomes the most powerful company in the world. JPow keeps the printer running and we let this new 30 year bull market take us all to Tendie Town.

But to answer the question I posed earlier...yes, there are people more autistic out here than you, but we‚Äôre the ones making money while you sit at home crying to mommy about how valuations matter. Stfu and get in while this thing is a bargain.

343,"Essentially, it could be. But the reason why there is the gap is that the warrants aren't exercisable yet and no one knows when that will occur as it's waiting on the SEC. Trigger 1 has happened in that it's 30 days after the merger but not trigger 2, which is the SEC approving NKLA S-1 filing. 

Once the S-1 is approved, then you'll be able to exercise, pay 11.50 per warrant (plus most likely 40-50 to your broker per transaction). The gap between warrants and share price will close extremely fast to stock price - 11.5 (this is what happened on Monday and Tuesday was the rapid sell off anticipating exercise and massive dilution).

It's not free tendies, arbitrage never is as risk free as it seems, but it could be a quick 27% profit.

345,"22 year old inheriting $25,000-$30,000 this week, looking for advice on how to invest it!  

So, as the title says, I‚Äôm a 22-year-old looking for advice about how to handle a roughly $25,000-$30,000 inheritance that I‚Äôm receiving. The money is in a Roth IRA at Fidelity. I have no idea what the money is currently invested in, how much is in buying power, and so on. I have a basic idea of how I want to manage the money, but I‚Äôm looking for some insight on if I‚Äôm in the right ballpark here and if so, how I could better execute my strategy. 

For starters, I‚Äôm probably going to sell everything, unless any of it overlaps with the ideas I‚Äôm going to lay out in this post.

From there, I want to invest half of the funds in dividend and value stocks, and index funds. 

I‚Äôm thinking at least a quarter of my entire portfolio spread across the three main US indexes, specifically invested in SPY, DOW, and QQQ. I‚Äôm interested in investing either the QQQ or SPY portion in a 3x daily bull fund that traces that fund, specifically either TQQQ or SPXL, let me know what you think about that.

The next eighth I‚Äôm wanting to invest into banks. Companies like JPM and C are underperforming the market so heavily right now, and they‚Äôve already confirmed that they‚Äôre not cutting dividends. Yes, share buybacks are suspended pending future earnings requirements but I believe that JPM and C are well positioned enough to resume buybacks at the latest by the end of Q1 2021. I genuinely believe that banks are discounted right now and have potential for a great return if they return to their ATH‚Äôs. I also like the prospect of their dividend income over time. 

The next eighth I‚Äôm wanting to put into funds specifically for their dividends. I don‚Äôt really care about the YoY return on these tickers; I‚Äôm just interested in the dividend. I‚Äôd want to spread it across SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. 

Now for the second half of the fund. I‚Äôm wanting to approach this half with a more high-risk, high-reward strategy. 

For the first half of this high-risk high-reward portion (quarter of my total portfolio), I‚Äôm just going to invest in growth stocks/ETFs. A couple of tickers I have in mind are ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN.

For last quarter, I‚Äôm not thinking YOLO on an FD type high risk high reward, but I‚Äôd definitely like to dabble in options. And this is the portion of my investment that I‚Äôm most open to suggestions and ideas. I have some basic ideas though. 

My 1st idea is to keep a quarter of the portfolio in cash and sell cash secured puts on companies that I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind buying 100 shares of at the strike. I‚Äôd want to continually do this up until the day I inevitably get assigned and then actually purchase those shares. A couple of tickers that I have in mind for playing like this are SNAP and NCLH, (yeah cruise line Robinhood meme stock I know). At which point I‚Äôd acquire the shares and then sell covered calls on the shares on the way up, just to reap in additional benefits, again, not minding if I get assigned and have to sell them for that strike. I kind of like this idea the best out of any that I‚Äôve had, just because it seems like the lowest risk, I‚Äôd be able to acquire 100 shares of a company that I see growth in, which would probably be the smartest long term play anyways. 

My 2nd idea is to buy LEAPS on banks, specifically JPM or C. I‚Äôd just buy calls within +5% of the strike and buy the furthest dated out possible. Simple yeah but I think getting a play with that much time and that much potential delta is a good idea, and its relatively low risk compared to my last idea.

My last idea is definitely the riskiest and basically, it‚Äôs just buying calls for cruises and airlines for June of next year. A potential vaccine announcement, stimulus in the form of travel expense related tax write-offs, as well as the incoming wave of cabin-fever induced travel frenzy are all factors that could honestly cause them to pop-off at any time within the next year. 

TLDR;

I‚Äôm a 22-year-old inheriting somewhere between $25,000-$30,000 this week and I want to manage the money myself. I‚Äôm pretending that each 8‚Äôth is about $3,000 to be conservative. My general idea is this:

Long-term, low risk: 

1/4 ‚Äì US indices, specifically SPY, DOW, and QQQ. Let me know what you think about putting either the SPY or QQQ portion into SPXL or TQQQ.

1/8 ‚Äì Banks, probably literally just JPM and C, maybe a little bit of WFC but they suck. 

1/8 ‚Äì Dividend stocks, specifically SPHD, MO, KO, ABBV, SPG, and VYM. 

Higher risk, higher reward:

1/4 ‚Äì High growth stocks and ETF‚Äôs, specifically ARKK, SOCL, SMH, AMD, FSLY, TSLA, APPL, MSFT, FB, and AMZN. 

1/4 ‚Äì Three different ideas. 1. Sell cash secured puts on SNAP and NCLH until I get assigned, at which point hold the shares and sell covered calls. 2. LEAPS on banks. 3. LEAPS on travel.

Look, I'm glad you made money, that is the point, but going on a forum and just saying, ""hey i made money!"" and then leaving is just pointless. So great, you made money, but how and why is what the point is..  

I made money today too, but it wasn't $14,000 and it wasn't worth me going to post about here.. However I did notice options chains on Vix and TQQQ today, so I am going to give HELPFUL info to those that want to look into it..



example:

The trade this week and next week is TQQQ (Apple and tech) and Vix (volatility)

VIX is already trying to spike, and TQQQ is already trying to push down to get ready for the jump from earnings.

So you actually will want to consider buying 2 week long calls and puts on both sides of TQQQ and VIX.

Close each side when there is profit at the end of this week or beginning of next week.


Notice Vix 28 calls and 30 calls.. 

Notice TQQQ 115 puts

Notice Vix 24 and 20 puts..

etc..",2020-07-21,0.034,0.771,0.195,0.9939

668,"Robyn Denholm - or why $TSLA doesn't give a damn about your opinion.Doing some research on why the shareholders meeting might be pushed back and/or asking for Robyn to be voted out as Tesla chair she seems to be the lynchpin.

Short DD - Elon is off the rails and she's his guide rails, but because no one will insure their board members (because of Elon), he's covering ""a policy"". A couple of people also think Elon is getting paid wayyy too much.

My opinion - she's been chair since Nov 2018 (when share price was ~350.00). $TSLA closed at $991.90 on Friday.

Their argument is she is supposed to protect the company from depending on the CEO to cover their board insurance/manage salaries.

This has to be THE dumbest vote ever.

Can you imagine seeing the success and rise in share price and saying ""we don't like it"".Elon has a plan and he's executing on it. This train doesn't slow down, and FFS imagine when Boring, SpaceX, Neuralink, or Starlink IPO. Imagine opening prices at $250 a share with $250Bln valuations. You don't get there paying someone $10Mln a year either (his shares are worth $1.6Bln currently).

He's $20Bln away from hitting his next trache.

If anything Elon has unlocked a cheat code we'll see more and more CEOs turn to. Where your CEO is tied to stock price outside of paydays. More boards will do this and it'll become the standard. Glass Lewis and ISS can get fucked.

Every night he‚Äôd pray to papa Elon to make his small account grow.

But this boy was a greedy little piggy and decided $280k was not enough. He now wanted 1 million dollars. So he traded and traded until his account got slapped in the face with a brick called Ron√£. He was back where he started and is slowly clawing his way back up.

Got an update that STX has ""unusual options activity.""   

Turns out that STX had 4,531 calls traded, 2x more than usual, and implied vol increasing over 7 points to 48.46%. Jan-21 37.5 calls and 7/10 weekly 54 calls are the most active options, with total volume in those strikes near 900 contracts. Now, I don't know what all those words mean exactly but I think we can all agree on one thing: ""I bEt ItS a HeDgE!"" 

But really, who has time to think when people are just slingin' STX 48C 7/02 

Anyway, 30 minutes after buying I thought to myself ""wait, what the fuck does STX even do...""

So just to be safe, I decided to pretend to care about how I lose my money. First things first, if I'm buying calls I follow my golden TSLA rule, check to see if the underlying company makes money. I don't want to be a dumbass and waste my time on a company that actually has earnings like some type of boomer fuckboi. Turns out STX makes earnings...and a dividend...man I feel gay right now. 

So naturally and because I'm a straight bull Chad, I panic. I decide to frantically research what banks and anal-ysts think because I  like having other people lie to me. Turns out Fidelity thinks that STX is ""undervalued"" and that people say its a buy. Sounds like something those retards would say...

However what advantage does options have over stocks? Because its more like gambling in case you pick the opposite side you can end up losing all the investment. However with stocks you can hold them longer and hope things return back to normal at some point. 

You can buy stocks in bulk which you couldn‚Äôt had example 1 contact of tsla where else 100 stocks on tsla gonna take your entire life earnings. So more like you can participate playing on high tables with options but the risk is still the same

825,"  Buying shares at XYZ 100 is not my choice when I could collect $5 and sell a put to potentially buy shares at XYZ 90.



     **Leverage**
100 shares = 100 shares; 1 option for 100 shares could cost ~10 shares.

     **Probability**
Buying stock is a 50/50 trade--that is, you begin winning or losing immediately. Collecting premium on a sold option pushes your breakeven downward, meaning you have some breathing space before it's a real loser.

     **Defined Risk**
By buying/selling multiple options, spreads can be created to enhance your position. I could open '10' XYZ 70-80 Call spreads for nearly the same cost of one 70 Call. This means greater return for less of a move in the stock, or simply less money tied up in that position.

     **Greeks**
Learn about time decay, implied volatility, delta,  acceleration  . . . If a stock dropped big or is suggesting a larger move and the puts get expensive, you could sell a put at a much better price than simply buying the stock at the current trade price.

    **Undefined Risk**
Once you learn some greeks, you might prefer some strategies over others--E.g., selling a put ratio spread(buy 1:sell 2) because buying deep OTM puts is expensive while for calls (buy 1:sell 2:buy 1) you might buy the far out wing because they're relatively cheap.",2020-06-21,0.064,0.818,0.118,0.8519

827,"Yes, in theory with stonks you have more time to recover. But imagine starting to trade options and only buying 3+ months out. You can not even begin to grasp how long of a time 3 months seem if you're trading options daily. When I'm talking about February it's a bit like a grandfather telling stories of his youth.

At the beginning I found options extremely dangerous, because at expiry you can lose it all - OMG I would never touch such a thing. But before expiry you lose more than with stonks, but if it goes the way you predicted, you win more with options than with stocks. Options actually work in your favour, as you win more than what you lose with the same movement of the underlying in opposite directions. Of course, your risk is increased, that's why potential profit also is.

Apply proper risk management, decide for the amount of cash you want to risk, don't forget that any trade you'll ever make can go exactly in the direction opposite of your expectation, don't keep pouring in more money without end and you'll be fine.",2020-06-21,0.082,0.776,0.142,0.9274
