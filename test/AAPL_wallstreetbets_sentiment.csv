3,"Hey guys! Wanted to make a post here to kind of lead some people in the right direction (and that‚Äôs whatever direction is right for them).
A few months ago I decided to learn stocks. I watched a ton of videos, made a book describing how to use every indicator, divergences, etc. Essentially, I was training myself to be able to make better educated decisions on where a stock will go considering an ‚Äúall-equals‚Äù market. 
I would tirelessly go on tik tok to find the next best ‚Äúwatchlist,‚Äù or follow forums and apply to Tim Sykes and shit lmao. Well; here‚Äôs the point!

Every day I‚Äôd look at a chart and say ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôll go here‚Äù by using technical analysis. I‚Äôve underStood the stock market is literally just a trading zone rn and NOT the long term bull market we know, and that‚Äôs awesome bc these chances come very little. But every time I‚Äôd make a decision on a stock, I‚Äôd come on here and hear everybody say ‚Äúred day,‚Äù ‚Äúfinally bulls get slapped‚Äù or even bulls saying the next day is green to mock bears. So I‚Äôd get worried and cancel my call assuming someone here knows something I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve come to tell you to STOP looking at this forum because all the stocks that are discussed the most are literal failures. WHY? Because if they hype is THERE then the stock already climbed. Some examples:
AZN two days ago was ‚Äútoo the moon‚Äù bc of news? Down almost 4% that day
Microsoft calls? Didn‚Äôt make it ppl were too bullish
AAPL 420 call? Too bullish 
Then these watchlists, here‚Äôs the trick: 
Pick stocks and out of 5, at least 2 will move just out of law of coincidence. Then the person who makes the watchlist will boast about those and completely IGNORE the literal 20 other stocks they picked for that week. 
Stop listening to hype and trust your gut. Even if you picked an option and the next day dwindles your trust dw.
I bought a call at 115 and the next day the stock dropped to 108 and I almost sold it. Flash forward to Monday and my call went up 300%. 
Make your own decisions and if you see something here that has traction, 9/10x it‚Äôs gonna be a bust :/
If you keep listening to hype you‚Äôre gonna become a professional at losing money, making emotional decisions, and panic selling. Good luck guys! And thanks for the money JPOW",2020-07-21,0.072,0.83,0.098,0.9267

Tesla Stock‚Äôs Run-Up Isn‚Äôt Over Yet. How to Play It With Less Risk.
By Steven M. Sears
July 23, 2020 6:00 am ET

Spencer Platt/
Wall Street can price just about anything, but it always seems to stumble around revolution and innovation. The general public generally struggles with valuation metrics but seems to understand the Next Big Thing with little trouble.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is a prime example.

The electric-vehicle company reported good earnings late Wednesday. Analysts had expected a loss. The stock surged even higher in the after-hours market, capping weeks of such strong bullish stock and options trading that it‚Äôs hard to fully convey the intensity of the action.

In recent weeks Tesla‚Äôs options have traded more actively than every stock in the S&amp;P 500 index other than Apple (AAPL). On average, over the past 20 sessions, about 575,000 contracts traded each day, and Susquehanna‚Äôs Chris Jacobson told his clients the majority of that volume was bullish call buying.


So far this year, Tesla‚Äôs stock is up some 281%. It is up 501% over the past year. During the past 52 weeks, the stock has ranged between $211 and $1,794.99. Tesla‚Äôs options are among the most actively traded in the market, and they have created incredible profits for aggressive investors.

The earnings results provide an opportunity to reset a trade that we recommended a month ago when the stock was sharply lower. At the time, Tesla was trading around $994.32, and we recommended that investors sell Tesla‚Äôs January $990 put for $191 and buy the January $1,005 call for $190. The trade paid investors $1 for agreeing to buy Tesla stock at a slightly lower price, while enabling them to participate in rallies above $1,005. At Wednesday‚Äôs close, the stock was around $1,592. The put was trading around $98, and the call was around $691, representing a 49% return on the put and 264% return on the call. During the same period, the stock rose 60%.

Any stock that trades above $1,000 is in rarefied territory, especially in the options market. Tesla‚Äôs options cost more than most stocks do. Still, options arguably represent one of the best ways to control such an expensive, hot stock, as they make it possible to somewhat define the risk and reward of the position, unlike just buying stock. If you buy stock, and the stock is cut in half, your losses would be far more substantial than if you had used options.

We used our favored risk-reversal strategy last month, but this time we want to readjust to reflect Tesla‚Äôs meteoric rise in the past month. The stock could keep rising, but it has advanced so much this year that it seems foolish to not at least consider the possibility that investors decide to realize profits on their stock or options positions, thus triggering a healthy decline in one of the world‚Äôs best-performing equities.


**To manage that risk without ceding exposure to higher highs, investors can consider a ‚Äúbull spread‚Äù that positions them for continued advances without meaningful exposure to weakness in the stock. It involves buying a call option and selling another with a higher strike price but similar expiration to potentially profit from any advances in the underlying stock.**

With Tesla trading around $1,637, investors could buy the January $1,650 call and sell the January $1,750 call for $40. If the stock is at $1,750 at expiration, the spread is worth a maximum profit of $60. (Each options contract represents 100 shares.)

The key risk to the trade is that the stock price falls to a level that is beneath the trading range that is mapped by the spread strategy. Should that happen, the trade fails, and investors would lose the money spent to establish the position.


Critics will say it is unwise to position for further gains in a stock that has advanced so far in such a relatively short period, but they have been saying that for the past 1,500 points. Instead, remember the old saw: Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one.

There is also some urgency required here as politicians are slowly starting to wake up to the fact that we are basically in a second gilded age. Calls for scrutiny of big tech's power are growing, mostly from the left. We know Donnie gets mad at twitter when they flag his tweets as horseshit, but he couldn't care less if AAPL buys some speaker company (spoiler alert). Another spoiler, the dems are winning in November. 

SO, big tech has another 6ish months to add new growth businesses to their oligopolies. Of course knowing this doesn't mean shit unless you know who might get acquired. And boooooy don't I, but I have some guesses. Positions here should be about 10-15 % out of the money, October expiration.

**Definite trades I'm considering**  
\*Ford is looking attractive to me for a long position.  
\*There's some definite plays to make in the cruise line industry right now. Notably NCL and RCL - consider a buy \*IF\* you think the cruise industry won't completely go under like I do.  
\*INTC is kind of being ignored right now, given the hype for AMD, and other tech stocks. Consider a buy depending on how the stock performs the next few days. Remember - intel still has ALL the market share in high end gaming PCs (for now) until AMD can really step it up with Zen 3 (Ryzen 4000 series GPUs  
\*NVDA is straight up a BUY. If you don't see how/why then honestly this stock is not for you. If you have traded it before - you know exactly why this stock will pretty much only go up until the RTX 3000 series officially drop.

\-----

Airlines. Kind of a shit show right now in my opinion. But... if you find AAL or DAL attractive at their current price points - consider a BUY

\-----  
**Fairly confident**

AMZN - fuck it at this point it can only go up right? BUY

TSLA - If you're not already in this stock (WTF are you doing?) Look for an entry point at 1350 or lower if at all possible the next week

MSFT - Honestly this has been a solid performer now for 5 years or so. BUY

GOOG, FB - Either buy or hold - depending on how much these EU and future American anti-trust laws worry you

AAPL - Fuck it. People are flocking to stocks they know, and honestly it might just keep going up. BUY or HOLD

306,"DD: New Fed Repo Schedule/analysis for what it means after today (SPY, VXX)In the midst of today‚Äôs storm, I am calm. Joyous even. Why? Because this weekend I signed up for the FED Financial Operations E-mail List Serve: **the new FED repo was released this afternoon and will give us a shot in the arm heading into the close tomorrow and EOW**. Here it is, and here's some analysis/confirmation bias

[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)

Context:

My previous DD on the FED Repo schedule ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd\_playing\_vxx\_and\_spy\_against\_the\_fed\_repo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/)) saw a connection between days of what became known on the sub as ‚Äúdouble pump days‚Äù and rises in SPY. These DPD‚Äôs were going smoothly on Tuesdays, but last week we hit a snag in the plan. What was the issue?

The issue became **no bids being entered for the Fed repos**. Jerome Powell extended his gracious hand, and the banks poo-pood it! What does this mean? It likely means one of two things:

1. After already taking issue with the rates and terms from when Repo operations began in daily capacity in the winter, there had been displeasure among the banks with the FED. This, combined with a new set of restrictive regulation standards borne of of the Stress Test Results, led banks to break from the Fed for Repo operations even if they weren‚Äôt necessarily on the financial footing to do so, needing to shun the additional liquidity based on terms.
2. The banks saw the market‚Äîand themselves‚Äîdoing so well now and in the near future from the recent euphoria that they balked at the FED‚Äôs increasingly aggressive rates.

**Recent history leads me to believe it‚Äôs a mixture of the two with the second being the larger factor by far:** the day they last offered a pump (repo loan) of 0 basis points on the overnight were 6/12 and 6/15, SPY increased 1.1% and .93% respectively. *What‚Äôs even more notable is that these came after a drop of 5.7%‚Äîsheeeesh*.(this will matter later)

Within last months Repo schedule, they weened the banks off of 0 basis points loans (literally free money) and started to introduce 5 point loans on 10 point days. This worked fine for a few weeks of double-pump-Tuesday bliss. But then last week, it failed and we dipped. Did the mechanism fail? No.

The banks refused to take the loans.

The FED was offering the lifeline while trying not to dive into more spending debt, and holding banks accountable through interest rates. Things were going well until today, and the banks likely thought they didn‚Äôt want‚Äîor need‚Äîthe increasingly high interest rate loans of the FED.

So what now and why does this shit matter

Now they do need it. We are approaching tragedy levels today. As they did when they took the money after we dipped 5% the day before the last 0 basis points loans, they will take this money tomorrow. They *need* to take this money for two reasons tomorrow:

1. Because the market will have a cascading fall affect if people link this to COVID numbers rising
2. More importantly, banks have their earnings run this week. It‚Äôd be a debacle if they didn‚Äôt shore up financials with some swift loans amongst each other.

Banks probably will not be as frenzied to borrow the loans as they were when they were 0 basis points, but tomorrow is the first double pump of the new calendar and the 5 basis point overnight +10 basis point term operation has been a fine combo for them up until they got cocky last week. In addition to the two factors above re: banks need this fucking money, there is a big factor as to why this will shore up today‚Äôs losses:

ROLLOVER DATES FOR FED REPO OPERATIONS PRINT BIGLY

I looked at each rollover date for new fed repo operation and GUESS what I found? ***On almost every rollover date‚Äîgoing back to last year when the operations weren‚Äôt even daily‚Äî SPY is elevated***\*\*.\*\* Even more of note, almost all the rollover date were preceded by a dip. The only time the rollover date didn‚Äôt elevate SPY was during the March crash, which is a no-brainer. Someone smarter than me can explain why rollover dates lead to jumps in SPY, but I do not believe that‚Äôs coincidence.

**These factors lead me to conclude that this was a correction today, and we will come out of through the week leading into another beautiful Monday.**

*What could go wrong? Problematizing factors include:* 1) the fact that the overnight repos are taking place in the afternoon this time around. I don‚Äôt know how that change affects things and didn‚Äôt have the time yet for that breakdown and 2) the beige book will be released this week, which carries some‚Äîbut not a ton‚Äîof weight depending on if they‚Äôre glass half full or half empty and 3) talk about UI benefits and stimulus 2 may heat up a bit, and you know how Mango be

**I will try to update here when I can, but do more stuff on my twitter of the same name because I can react quicker to news and such.** For all the people who think I‚Äôm spouting permabull insanity, here‚Äôs a picture of the last time I played VXX last month so you can see my only allegiance is tendies. I have no quarrel with you bear folk.

So the repo market is at a stall since there's nothing else to purchase. JPow said himself, he can have all the money in the world but he can't make companies take it.

So my portfolio is entirely naked calls and puts. I have the classic story of more than doubling my money at first and losing all my gains after. Down around 25% right now and I need to stop being an idiot.

I have 3 $AAPL 400c for 8/21 that got wrecked pretty hard last week. Can I sell, for example, 3 410c 8/21 to limit my losses? I assume it would be ideal to wait for those to gain some more value and sell them for a higher premium. Do I receive the premium money in my account immediately or only upon expiration? Is the best case scenario that the call I bought is ITM at expiration while the one I sold is OTM? What happens at expiration if I don‚Äôt have capital to exercise or fulfill any options? Is there a situation or strategy where it makes sense to close all positions before expiration to guarantee profit? 

I tried this once before but it seems like in RH it won‚Äôt show it as a spread the same way it would if you purchased a spread from the start so I felt nervous and just closed out everything before being in a situation I didn‚Äôt understand.

487,"$SPY Forecast for 7/30Key $spy lvls for tomm: Plz bear with me. I am going to give you a lot of levels and they are all key. I only am this time around because of the 4 big tech earnings tomm after hours (amzn, goog, aapl, fb) so a lot of uncertainty. I usually like to keep it minimal as possible. Use them based on ur positions. 


312.07, 315.50, 317.65, 318.95, 320.58, 321.09, 322.09, 323.58*, 324.93, 325.75, 326.93*

Bullish scenario üöÄ: 321.70-323.19 solid support. We held 323.58 today after a nice volume push. Now look for 324.93+ to hold, we actually had a nice volume push in one attempt today. Next stop is 325.75-326.93. If we bust through 327 with high volume. Next gap is straight to 332.59 


Bearishü©∏: Look for 323.58-322.09 to break down towards 321.70 area (that was start of pullback on bloody Monday (7/13). 318.95-315.50 is tough. Unload/ scalp puts at that area. 

TLDR: Kang Gang between: 321.09-323.58-325.75



7/29 recap: came out strong. I know I was bearish yday (personally) however you should always have a game plan which is why I give both bullish and bearish scenarios. My bullish scenario from yday was pretty spot on. I never delete lines, but add and they all mean something (explained on 7/28 forecast post) 

Very very low volume morning. We opened right at one of my previous lines at 322.09 area and rode all the way to 323.58 and tested that area twice. Third time was a charm on high volume push. It came down and broke it right towards that key 323.18 level, bounced and back with high volume push. Same exact scenario with 324.93 area around 245pm est. 

Idk what tomm holds, more bullish than bearish. I really wanna see a high volume push past 327. We tried like 8 times last week.

503,"I just pussied out of a 32.5 bagger. AMA.Hello my fellow autists. I‚Äôm not one at all to tread on my past or get upset on missed out plays but I just fucked up IMMENSELY. 

This Tuesday I made a really really risky play. I bought 1 AAPL 400C 7/31 for 0.75, I spent all night looking for a play that would have a fantastic payout just like that silly camera company who is now apparently an elite pharmaceutical drug manufacturer. I came across AAPL reporting earnings. 

I knew this was my play, I was so confident with this play, I decided to drop another $890.00 on the same exact calls but this time with a price of 0.89 each. 

The next day was awful. I had 4 co-workers call me an absolute moron and to kiss my money goodbye. My own brother told me I was chasing butterfly‚Äôs and I was going to end up tripping on air and smashing my face into a rock. My best friend (7 year investor) told me I was FOMOing hard due to missing out on all of these 10 baggers and that this play was ‚Äúextremely unrealistic.‚Äù 

That broke my top, I allowed other people in my life to convince my that my play was garbage and my money would be good as toilet flushed after earnings. About 10 minutes before close on Thursday, I sold for a total profit of 38%.

I felt pretty decent turning $950 into $1331.70 EXACT.

30 minutes later I knew I just made the worst decision in my life. AAPL instantly jumped 6.5% the second earnings were announced. My heart actually stopped. 

I actually just allowed myself to miss out on my 32.5 bagger all because I allowed tards in my life rule over my decision with their scary looking words such as ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù and ‚Äúmoneyless‚Äù.

If I would‚Äôve held until 5 minutes before close today, I would‚Äôve made exactly $29,778.62

I could‚Äôve just turned a measly 950 into THIRTY GRAND. 

I could‚Äôve just paid off college, gotten a car, and put a down payment on an apartment all off of ONE PLAY.

I‚Äôve never experienced regret like this in my entire life. Not only did I basically convince myself that this was at least a 10 bagger play on Tuesday, but it ended up being a fucking 30 bagger play and I missed out all because I pussied out last second.

What I learned today:
NEVER let someone else‚Äôs opinions determine your actions EVER. Today I deleted A LOT of investing apps and platforms because I did notice they influenced my decision A LOT. Hell even this sub adapts my thought a ton, but I won‚Äôt leave because I need at least my subreddit to keep my addiction happy. 

ALWAYS trust your gut. Even if the play ends up worthless, it‚Äôs still better losing your money on your call that on someone else‚Äôs, or even worse, missing a 30 bagger souly because of someone else‚Äôs input.

I think I‚Äôm going to YOLO on SQ FD‚Äôs because their earnings report is going to be JUICY. 

Thanks for your time fellow auts. I hope you all experience this same exact situation one day without the fact your fellow companions changed your thought process and then proceed to lose your entire goal of a juicy 30 bagger.",2020-07-31,0.114,0.69,0.197,0.9958

First, if you bought 0dte 420 they were going for .16 finished at  8$. Way more Xbagger than that.

Third, these plays happen all the time. 3 ago i hated my life when tesla went from 1380 to 1550 on one friday afternoon. 

&#x200B;

What I am trying to say is that there is a pattern. Look for a few things, that I identified myself:

Week of earnings, solid company.

Check weekly options.

If earnings are good buy eight before expiration, small size.

On the day of expiration, check how the stock behaves, if it is up and stays up, buy a small 300-500$ position 20-30 points OTM and let it run til 3;45pm. Think about that money as gone "" losing 300-500$"".  Dont make stupid calculations like "" i woulda bought 500 contracts for "".16"" because you wouldnt, I wouldnt, even someone with a 100k account wouldnt unless they are fucking crazy.

Key $spy lvls: 330.00, 331.17, 332.10*, 332.59, 334.40, 335.27, 336.68

I think volatility picks up more today. I personally will be playing with 0dte across the board. A lot of us missed out on a 166-200(peak) bagger last wk with Apple calls.[AAPL FOMO](https://imgur.com/a/JBqBKRF)


Bullish scenario üöÄ: 330 is solid support. I don‚Äôt see use going past that. We channeled between 331.17-332.59. (Hmmmm I wonder where those levels came from, hah). 332.59 was tested many times, we got a nice volume push towards eod. We got allll the way up to 334.40 (hmmmm). Next stop is 335.27. We first need high volume push past 334.40 area into 335.27

Bearish ü©∏: sry bears not much, look for 332.59-331.17 to break down towards 330. I would scalp puts at that area and see if it breaks. If it does, next stop is 328.80. Scalp more or all. 

TLDR: Kang gang between: 332.10-332.59-334.40-335.27

8/6 recap: opened around 331.75 and went up to 332.10 and pushed with volume (buy or sell print idk). We went to test 332.59 which would fill a large gap. Algos dropped spy all the way down to 331.17 (hmmmm)  and bounced right off all the way to test 331.93 x 3. Third time was a charm and then spy started to bust through 332.59 with very high volume, filling a large gap from the rona drop. Next we went to test 334.40 (hmmmmm) and failed to push with high volume. I like where we are at. Next stop is 335.27 area.

5. Apple Pay and other transaction facilitation platforms
6. Their growing device portfolios
7. Their growing services portfolios
8. Anti-trust wins
9. Others. :)

*Note: moves updates will be mostly on Twittuh (same name) because it gets super hard to follow them on the post structure here; I got complaints last time on organization that I can't really control in this medium.*  *I'm really happy plays from Tendie Stimulus 1 and 2, The Repo DDs, and MRNA DD worked out well for lots of you.*

*I am the furthest thing from a financial advisor you can imagine.  These are my thoughts.  Do your own DD of course.*

\*\*\*\* 

**Tendie Stimulus 2 post-mortum** 

For myself last week, **SPOT** and **MRNA** were my big duds I had to dump quick quick, and these **MSFT** bags I'm holding from EOD Friday are getting miiiiighty heavy--but jury is still out.  I think and hope MSFT/TikTok pushback from WH is more negotiation tactic than anything to get more companies to divest (more on that later).  **CRWD, PYPL, SQ, all printed** for me, with CRWD printing very bigly. **The week for me was up \~110%** (moves tracked in time-stamped edits and on Twitter).

*That said, let's dive in to what may have an impact this week, starting with the Stimulus*  

*\*\*\** 

**Stimulus Talk Updates: Checks, UI Extension, Lawsuit Liability, and Deadline**  

* **$1,200 checks are a done deal**, **whats important?:** 
   * 1) $75,000 income cap remains intact 
   * 2) now paying additional $500 for ALL dependents (previously 17 and under)
   * 3) these stimulus cannot be paid out until a deal is reached
* **UI extension, BENEFITS OFFICIALLY EXPIRED FRIDAY:** Dems have not indicated they will budge off $600.  Repubs came back with $200.  Democrats Mutombo rejected that offer and GOP came back with a $600 one week extension offer.  True to her word, Pelosi rejected the temporary offer as I stated last week; no ""piece meal"" approaches will be accepted by Dems because they have the upper hand.  It's a bold stategy, Cotton, let's see if it pays off.  
   * ^(NOTE: Blue states, such as CA, are reaching into their own coffers to extend the UI.  So, look for whether your state has committed to continuing it's unemployment enhancement, potentially.)
* **Liability protection from COVID lawsuits**: McConnell has gone from saying this is non-negotiable to saying there is some wiggle room.  Lawsuits are already beginning to flow in, according the WSJ.  Look for this to become a talking point for GOP to try to establish some form of leverage.

***Stimulus talks scale of importance: 7/10*** 

The Stimulus Negotiations from last week have convinced some that while the stimulus talks going sideways is an extrapolating factor that can move markets downward in conjunction with other economic turmoil, the stimulus going poorly by itself doesn't move markets--the case cited for this is that UI benefits ran out on Friday, and shit still popped off bigly green.  But a deeper look at Friday reveals that it was actually a red day across sectors if you take big tech companies with heavy weight out of the picture. I'm not cherry picking; **had the Big 4 earnings not been scheduled the day before UI ran out, Friday could've been a blood bath.** 

***How Stimulus talks may play out, and play out in the market:*** 

The Senate has been firm on not extending their session past the scheduled August 7th break.  If that stands, **although the logistics of a deal seem like it's impossible to complete before Friday, I believe they will; it's mutually assured political destruction otherwise**, which would pale in comparison to the budget negotiation crisis earlier in the decade.  I am looking for Pelosi to offer concessions on Liability Protections, which is important to GOP, in exchange for an extended UI offer of $400-$500 through EOY, with a grace period of continued high enhancements (probably $500 or $600) through mid-August or until checks arrive.  This allows Americans to properly prepare by spending it all on more iPhones, as well as receive backpay for the lapsed week starting 7/31. 

**My hunch is Monday will be a news blood bath regarding the extension working out which will give SPY a big morning-afternoon dip, followed by recovery EOD into Tuesday.**  I can see it now, dozens of news stories profiling moms who are losing their benefits and saying their kids will starve, they'll miss rent, etc.  *If you're holding 8/3's or FDs, I'd strongly urge you to consider taking the profits at open if we open green from overnight trading.* 

***Eyeball test on how it will affect markets*****:** I fish multiple times a week, and without fail *Walmart has a line around the block on Mondays and Tuesdays even larger than ones on Saturdays (UI benefit payments are on Monday)*.  Also, the electronics department is always completely raided of EVERYTHING.  Retail electronics (home computers, phones, tablets, gaming systems so ROKU, SONY, etc) will likely falter bigly if talks seem to sputter. 

\*\*\*

**The Fed Repo Schedule: say it with me-- Lick-WID-it-TEE (scale of importace, 9/10)** 

If you haven't, you may want to check out my https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hqn08u/dd\_new\_fed\_repo\_scheduleanalysis\_for\_what\_it/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x  on additional liquidity in markets through what I refer to as ""pump days"", ""double pump days"", ""rollover dates"", and repo bids.

**We are in line for a ""double pump"" on Tuesday**.  For a long period this meant, almost always, SPY would go green.  However in June, probably due to improving market conditions, the bids on those repo operations stopped (this meant the fed was offering the money, and people weren't taking it.  I took a look at this week's chart, available [here](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&amp;startDate=01/01/2000&amp;enddate=01/01/2000) and noticed something interesting:   


[1 bid was entered Friday](https://preview.redd.it/9pu0khhz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=011b415534c558be4783b655faa93669451c9e18)

[1 overnight bid Thursday](https://preview.redd.it/vb5gxihz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d627b138accf17aae67620576169d2dfc360242)

[ 8 overnight bids Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/0tfg8mhz0oe51.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c59893f356d85c4c54309fb5d84f260b6990aef3)

**They're taking the money again.**  This was the first week in the past two months where we saw bids entered on overnight operations 3 days in a row.  Duds mostly, but big action on Thursday.  There are two ways to take this  

1. **Liquidity being back is a bad thing** because it means that borrowers are trying to stave off economic turmoil and a coming leg down.  This theory is bolstered by the large amount of put option activity that has been happening in August
2. **Liquidity being back is a good thing** because it means, well, more liquidity.

I did a search on liquidity operations the week of the June 11th mini crash, and there were massive amounts of bids preceding the fall (admittedly last week's levels are NOWHERE near that, but it's more than zero).  So that could, *in theory*, bolster the bearish argument through logic of:

 ^(increased liquidity operations+more put activity in large blocks =) **^(coming fall)**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ff0hmt872oe51.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a488fdde05a0e4b7299d94e23b7d596145ad4d74

At least through Wednesday, however, I'll be going with the old quote: Don't Fight the Fed. I'm bullish on this liquidity for now given our current relative stabilization. I'll be looking closely at what the bids are as the week progresses, and when I see a good opportunity dip on Monday I will enter **SPY 327c 8/7.**  Again, depending on the bids, I will likely hold through **Wednesday afternoon, then look to take advantage of Stimulus gloom and doom posturing with a VXX 28c or 29c 8/7** depending also on how low VXX is at that point. 

 \*\*\* 

**GYNA!!!! (Importance: 10/10, fallout is NOT priced in)** 

As a I predicted, the fuckery with China is not over.  MSFT is in the crosshairs, which I'll get to in a moment, but more importantly [Pompeo on Sunday said they about to talk big shit on Chinese companies beyond TikTok this week](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/politics/mike-pompeo-trump-action-tiktok/index.html). As we all know, China likes to reciprocate, and I genuinely feel like this is the only market factor right now not ""priced in"", as people say.  This, in combination with other factors, is why I am bearish on probably Wednesday EOD-Friday morning.  [Considering that China will likely retaliate against NOK and ERIC for the Huawei drama in UK we caused](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-may-retaliate-against-nokia-and-ericsson-if-eu-countries-move-to-ban-huawei-11595250557), I am playing this Wednesday or Thursday with:  

**VXX 28c or 29c Wednesday or Thursday,** depending on how low it is and what day Trump anounces Gyna news   
 If China says they will retaliate, Thursday maybe: **NOK 8/14 5p** (if they break 5 convinvingly by Wednesday) 

\*\*\*  
**My 'Scared Money Don't Make None Get Rich or Die Trying High-Risk Bet of the Week'**   
 Vaccine pump is coming bigly to the rescue at some point this week, but I don't hae faith in MRNA (see previous scathing DD), PFE and big companies are pretty lazy movers outside  of trial results, and the others I am kind meh on. 

**So I am playing vaccine pump indirectly through airlines, specifically ALK.**  Yes, more bad COVID news is coming out, and I'm hoping that happens on Monday AM so I can hop in EOD or Tuesday morning once the gloom and doom for the week is over.  Better cash flow than the others, better managed, equivealent growth potential, and more resistant to daily COVID trends than others according to the charts.  If I can get some red on them Monday, EOD I'm going bigly on  

**ALK 8/14 35c** and dumping after a pop  

**\*\*\*other shit\*\*\*** 

How I'm playing earnings this week: 

**SQ** has a lot of chatter.  Ive been holding it for this run-up, and am going to dump right before ER, then pick it back up at a dip the next day.  Why?  

* ***SQ is good, cash app is explosive, but SQ just isn't PYPL*** because of they do so much work with POS sale systems in stores that are shuttered.  That said, retail at many places has actually been better than expected and small business are integrating SQ into their online-facing order systems at a rapid pace.  I also think that, like PYPL, their forward guidance will smack based on Direct Deposit options and broadening base of users from UI extensions, etc.  Plus, you know, fucking E-thots.  Anecdotally, lower income brackets also seem prefer Cash app to PYPL/Venmo, and that is the group that saw the most benefit from UI (if you know why please explain in comments).  I still don't know for certain it'll beat cheeks though because of in-store POS losses, so I'm going to take my profits on Wednesday, then buy back in once IV settles for a nice little run through next week.
* ***Also anti-earnings because PYPL ""only"" popped 6% AH*** after running, had a quick 5 minute morning run up then crashed.  I consider PYPL the SQ 'best case scenario' comparison.  A potential 6% pop on crazy IV just isn't worth the dice roll, imo.
* ***Current position:*** **8/7 32c I'll sell Wednesday before ER**.  **Thursday** will pick up an **8/21 135c** or higher if they do kill earnings and explode.

**For all the other big ones like ATVI, NET, etc, I'm just going to see who pops, hope for a morning dip next day, then go all in Friday with some ODTE on a popular one like net**.  Partly a logic play, partly AAPL fomo.   


**These fucking MSFT bags** 

Really hoping Trump and Satiya don't eiffel tower me on these **8/7 205c**'s I picked up on Friday, but right now ya boy is feeling like a potential spit roast.  I'm just going to grind it out--I have faith TikTok deal will get done this week, as Trump likely just wants to give Chinese companies a redscare and show them that selling to Americans is the only thing that will save them. 

  
 \*\*\* 

 !!!!!**TLDR!!!!!** 

This week has an unnerving amount of factors in the air including Stimulus Negotiations, increased liquidity operations utilization through Repo, and GYNA.  I believe the beginning of the week will see a run on liquidity to boost markets after a falter through mid day Monday.  I think that money will shift to airlines and other beaten down markets at some point, and will play it for pop but not hold longer. 

**Currently bagholding with confidence:** 

**MSFT** 205c 8/7 

**SQ** 132c 8/7 (pre earnings dumping)

**Beginning of week buying during dip:** 

**SPY** 327c 8/7, 8/14 

**ALK** 35c 8/14 

**SQ** 135c 8/14 (post earnings buy)

**EOW** 

**VXX** 8/7 28c or 29c depending how low it is 

**NOK** 8/14 5p (if it crosses 5 big beginning of week)

Made a few k but looking at those contracts in my notes and realizing those would have actually turned out into fucking 2.14MM doesnt let me sleep at night. I hate myself. I literally can‚Äôt do anything else with my day. It eats me alive.

712,"I just make a plan and stick to it. If you decide to do something, it shouldn‚Äôt be susceptible to you ‚Äúchickening out‚Äù. It sounds like your not exactly upset about the money you missed out on per se, instead you are disappointed in the fact that you didn‚Äôt follow through on your word and on your plan. I would encourage you to take a good hard look at your actions going forward, and only make an action if you are committing to it fully. 

On top of that, I repeat a mantra to myself which I made up ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hatch your chickens before they count‚Äù. In other words, if you are confident in a play, you should not feel the need to change the plan. You should have an exit strategy established before you even open the play, and you should stick to it. If I buy a call for an earnings play, and it goes up 100% before earnings, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because my decision and my plan was to hold thru earnings. 

TLDR: you‚Äôre more disappointed in yourself for not staying true to your word, than you are about missing out on the money.

EDIT: to add a little bit of advice that is more ‚Äúpractical‚Äù, one strategy I do is when I sell something (according to the original plan), I DO NOT look at the stock anymore after selling. When I sold my UPS 7/31 calls on Thursday morning at open, I told myself that I wasn‚Äôt going to look at the stock anymore because it is likely I didn‚Äôt sell at the entire top and I would only end up feeling like I fucked up and left some gains on the table.",2020-08-01,0.062,0.807,0.131,0.9414

Slight tweak from 7/31 forecast. Not much has changed tbh, except a new print at 323.97. 

Bullish scenario üöÄ: 323.97-324.93 is nice support. Look for it to hold. We pushed through 324.93 with a very high volume, which is good. I really like spy at 325.13 area as healthy support for where we are in potential stim talks. Next, we need a nice amount of volume now trading around 326.92 area to break AND hold 327+ potentially. We got to this area like 15 times in last two weeks. Like I said before, next gap is straight to 332.59. 

Bearish ü©∏: look for 323.19-322.85 to break down towards 322.09-321.09 area. I would scalp puts in between these two areas. If we do get down to those levels, expect some kangaroo action until next high volume push back up. If that support breaks, I can see us going down towards 318.95, which is very strong. Unload all puts. 

TLDR: Kang gang between: 322.85-323.97-325.13-326.92


Personally looking at 0dte 326-328p right at open. May hedge portfolio with some 315p, depending on stim talks, unsure exp. Also watch for AAPL and MSFT if they push higher. Both are what really carried the market last 30 min on Fri. 

7/31 recap: opened around 326+ and immediately red down to 322.85 area and bounced back to 324.38 level and tested it but failed and went back down towards 321.09 key level by 1pm est. Solid bounce back and tested 322.85 again but failed back down to 322.09. After that was an amazing bull run all the way to 326.53.

775,"AAPL gonna split, maximising your tendiesLadies and gentlemen, fellow retards, valued autists,

AAPL will split stocks on Aug 24th. For the retards not knowing what that means: stock gets split. So instead of one stock worth 445, you'll get 4 each worth 111,25.

Why does that matter? According to historians, AAPL splitting stock has always moved the price up until the actual date of the split (source: internet).

Why do we care? Tendies of course. Look at this beautifully annotated chart analysis of mine:

[Professionally annotated chart of AAPL displaying the current trend](https://preview.redd.it/bc8u1vsfysf51.png?width=1916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c5cf2f0d8a32bfed37b2674cf4f83fbe871eed)

We see the current trend AAPL has been on the past 3 Months. First thing to notice is the üåàüêªs dumping just before earnings. Yet bulls win again. Now, might I lead your attention to the second spike on last Wednesday / Friday. This was a reaction and rejection due to the stimulus that did not get through. After hours, it continued the trend it's currently on.

Now what, you may ask? Why does that matter? Look at this next chart:

[Directions AAPL can go on Monday](https://preview.redd.it/5hwn680wzsf51.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=648899d861fa07bd26a6499d99eea013e247c911)

Basically AAPL can go three ways. It can continue its trend after earnings (1). It can revert back to its previous trend (2). Or it can dump (3).

In cases 1 and 2 we'll make tendies, no questions asked. So my current plan is to monitor which direction this stonks on Monday. If I see confirmation of 1 or 2 I'll enter on Tuesday with an ITM call option.

Exit is right before the split, on the 21th. SL will be around 10 - 15 %. PT potentially at 33 %. I will definitely get out before the split on the 24th. If you decide to buy multiple contracts, you can sell half on the 21th and keep your remaining diamond hands.

I posited in an earlier post that the top investors at Apple pushed for the 4:1 split, expecting either retail bagholders or increased liquidity for options. (Maybe that last idea developed in the comments.)

Either way, Bank of America pissing on AAPL can't fit into Warren Buffet's master plan. So he doubled his position on BAC. I know the timing is a little off, and bank PE values are low making them a good long-run buy. But in this coincidence I have a theory that the analyst's rating will be adjusted to take into account some news happening in the next 10 days. What news? Anything. Because the new 25% owner doesn't want to see infighting.

798,"Where is AAPL going after the split?We learned today what has been true since the ipod:  Apple is indirectly receiving cash from the US treasury via a long line of credit, some overseas manufacturing, artistic branding, and your mother's monthly disability check.  Straight profit.

Google says a stock split is a neutral event.  Bullshit.  No one rich does anything except for them and they boys goin' get richer.  Tim not-Cook-the-books says a 4:1 split will allow more people to participate in owning Apple stock.  This implies that he sees an advantage to an over-valued Titan class tech stock being easier to own by retail investors (compared to Google, Tesla, Amazon,... Berkshire Hathaway).  Let's get real.  Retail invest investors can already buy fractional shares on the easiest app to download onto an apple iphone.  Does he think that more people would ch0ose to buy AAPL over GOOGL or AMZN or MSFT or even NFLX?  Or that dumbass retail investors will think going from $100 --&gt; $120 is the same as running from $380 --&gt; $400?

In these instances, the post-split stock would quickly run up faster than pre-split, allowing Industry and Oligarchs to slip out the back door without crashing the retail party.  Then us bagholders wonder why AAPL can't climb above $125 for the next decade.

Speaking of Berkshire.  How much AAPL is coursing through Omaha's ground water?  Google says 245M shares (5.6%). Interesting. Vanguard Group owns 7.3% [and Vanguard owns 9.5% of itself, that means that Vanguard investors that own AAPL are double positioned on to AAPL].  No Ducking way these guys are pushing Tim Cook to help the small guys make money.

Assuming that V and BRK know the music is slowing down and they need someone to dance while they slip out the back, and assuming that a lower bar to entry means dumber, eager buyers, I present three scenarios:

1.  Stock runs up in anticipation of the split.  A future cheaper price means more investors will buy in after the split, effectively allowing current white collars to buy in bulk at a discount now over competing with the filthy wage earners later.  V and BRK start paring down their piggy bank.  Ease it out a few million shares a week.  Once we realize they are gone we just sit in a sideways party together.

2.  Stock is sideways to split.  Google says a stock split is neutral so nobody panics.  Inside their corner offices, V and BRK are shitting their pants.  What if retail doesn't show.  Trump might try to push off the elections and deploy BORTAC to quell transgender bathroom users in Arizona.  Retail is too busy with other shit to get a rise out of AAPL.  Once the split happens, V and BRK GTFO as the newest WSB boys show up to YOLO 5DTE $150 Calls.  Stock drops.  Theta gang has to payout $90 to own $80 stock.  Then they start selling $91 Calls, but WSB already YOLO'd.

#3.  AAPL runs up like #1, but then falls like #2.  Probably something to do with V and BRk earning statements coming out or they need to buy a shit ton of farmland from retirees right now and don't have time to tiptoe out the back.

To me, it seems impossible that AAPL drops back sub $400.  4:1, August (4x2 month) 24 (twentieth plus fourth day).  The numerology is there.  Not going below $400.  It also seems impossible to me that we will continue to see 83% annual gains for AAPL after the retail fuck-bois drive up the post split price.  I won't get a bear tatoo, but I think this split is a sign of the smart money trying to sneak out. (I've said that like five times now.)

855,"Amazon‚Äôs going big on food delivery... how to profit from it SIZZ $190 calls üöÄIf your interested in a pre-covid play that hasn‚Äôt been discussed on here much lately, listen up. This one will most likely continue to grow after a vaccine or the election, get ready for the tendies.  I‚Äôve been looking for somewhere to park my Aapl and Tsla gains.  and I think I‚Äôve found it.  This company has positioned itself to knock out both Uber and Lyft in the food delivery market, as the landscape is  changing daily.  

If your not aware, the kind of model where you can order from any restaurant through a single is outdated and gradually being phased out, as companies like Hometown Buffet continue to post y/y revenue and guidance beats (stock up 798% past 5 years).  

The company that will destroy Uber, Lyft, grub hub and all the other silly Silicon Valley soy boys who thought they knew the food delivery market is called Sizzler.  Sizzler is a brand new tech company that‚Äôs bringing the buffet directly to the consumer. Sizzler is breaking ground with new products like an in-restaurant slurpee machine and all you can eat garlic cheese bread.  At their last q2 earnings call, ceo Brad Nutbuster announced a partnership with AMZN, positioning Sizzler with enough cash to continue innovating in the nutritional delivery industry while it outperforms its competators once annother year.  This company has successfully grown in the past 3 months to be a household name corona stock in the food delivery sector by bringing investors new innovations like the garlic meatball sub platinum credit card, and the Dino nugget to go boxes that now come with every adult meal (used to just come with kids dinner).  I could go on and on with this one, but I‚Äôll let the tendies do the talking. Literally.

But wait.....There is more

Putting my account into AAPL investment. Notice I said the word ""investment"" not ""bet"", like some of you truth retards do. 

Imagine able to own a piece of APPLE Pie for only $120 after the Pie has been cut. Like who the fuck wants to pay an Xbox One for an APPLE Pie right? Exactly, unless you leech off your parent's inheritance maybe you would consider.

480 before split  = 4 x 120 /per share     Very reasonable price for a high tech. company that's been around since you were a baby.

&amp;#x200B;

I've done my own DD, asked my friends if they will pay for $120 for an AAPL share, rather than 480 and 90% of them said ""yes"" and 10% said ""What's AAPL?"" 

Yea they can ban WeChat, yea they can ""China"" this ""China"" that, you honestly think that's gonna stop AAPL from thriving? Think again. AAPL has TV, Music, APP, Phone, Laptop, Desktop, Watch and in the future perhaps even a better ""AI support"" for SIRI, like you can literally not gonna be a loner and hide under your mom's basement and watch porn all day! The future SIRI will actually talk to you like a normal person would.

&amp;#x200B;

Invest in a solid stock, not some hype shit. The stock price went up is not solely based on the hype shit but it was also based on the fundamental value of AAPL. I know this stock will only go up in the future as it has in the past 20+ years. Now it's your time (No fuck you, I meant ""Now it's my time) to dip 3k into the future of this company, because I believe their value rather than a ""get rich quick scheme"".

&amp;#x200B;

""Fcuk I wish I bought AAPL when it was only $120"", well shit it ain't gonna be 120 in six month son.

I‚Äôm a mod on the whale trading discord! I am not sure if this is supposed to go here, but wanted to help you guys with tendies and avoid the bagholding. So, control your alerts! 

For example, say you wanted to alert across *all* of AAPL‚Äôs option contracts with updates on any contracts when there is a volatility dip. So you could set up AAPL alert for when implied volatility is less than 30%! 

Or maybe even more useful, say you want to be alerted when an AAPL (it‚Äôs two-freaking-trillion) contract has massive amounts of volume, ie greater than 5,000, and the open interest is less than 10, and implied volatility is equal to 50%.¬† This will show you an option movements at the time of alert based on this, and any big bids/sells/buys/etc that came from it. You can now do this [from the options alerting page](https://unusualwhales.com/user_alerts)! Here is a video of this being done:¬†[https://gyazo.com/c5419961ff602610e705eb97a76f7b9c](https://gyazo.com/c5419961ff602610e705eb97a76f7b9c)

Key $AAPL lvls: 452.03, 452.93, 455.10, 457.65, 459.97, 461.30, 464.15 (ATH area)

I like 452.03 as new support. 457.65 was ATH and we manage to bring in high volume push past ATH to a new high of 464.15. We tested that area only like one time and we failed to push past with high enough volume. We then kept dropping past key spy lvls to 452.03. We managed to bounce off it to a closing of 459.78. Next stop up are 461.30 and 464.15 (ATH area) keep an eye on 464.15 cuz we will üöÄ past once we get nice high volume push AND hold.

TSLA can go bankrupt due to lack of profitability and liquidation value is about $100/share. Definitely unlikely, but the $600 2 year leap puts currently have a 30% chance of expiring ITM and an expected move of $2200. Terrible risk to reward ratio buying TSLA at all time hype highs and this is pure FOMO buying.
